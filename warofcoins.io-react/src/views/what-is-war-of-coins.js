              War of Coins is extremely simple to use. You only need to choose
              the direction of the cryptocurrency price - whether it will go up
              or down. The further the price goes in the direction you choose,
              the higher the payout - up to 100 times the amount of purchase.

              All transactions are handled by a smart contract working on a
              public blockchain. The conditions of the purchase (such as amount
              and price ladder at the moment of purchase) are recorded on the
              blockchain and cannot be altered, erased, or forgotten. Upon
              maturity time, the smart contracts record the prices at maturity
              and calculates payouts for all recorded transactions for this
              maturity time.

              Smart contracts also implement risk management policy and rules.
              All purchases are guaranteed by the liquidity pool, and the
              contract will not accept purchases that can, in the worst-case
              scenario, require payouts that will exceed the amount of funds
              allocated from liquidity pool for the session. The max payout for
              each purchase is determined by smart contract based on risk
              exposure status ranging from 2X to 100X.
